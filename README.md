# How Voter Turnout (for Older Adults) in the 2020 Election Could Be Impacted by the COVID-19 Pandemic in Maryland
// TODO when done at end 
2-3 sentences that explain your “business question” and some high-level findings and suggestions. Tell the reader a little bit about your business question, why this is important, a high-level finding, and the future implicateions of your findings. Make this short and captivating so that the user wants to continue reading about this topic and what you’ve done. 

## Background
As the 2020 National Election approaches and the novel coronavirus continues to spread across the country, COVID-19 presents many challenges to campaigns and voting efforts beyond the already existing factors. Measures to prevent the further spread of COVID-19 have led to cancelled events of all kinds- from sports seasons to campaign rallies, concerts to canvassing. To date, 15 states have already restructured or rescheduled their presidential primaries [(1)][https://www.nytimes.com/article/2020-campaign-primary-calendar-coronavirus.html].

Unlike the primary elections, however, the date of the general election is set by federal law which means that postponing it would not only be a tremendous political ordeal, but would also potentially result in social upheaval. However threatening this pandemic, we cannot let it interrupt out democratic process and disenfranchise voters. While it is still unclear how the United States will find itself in just a matter of months, we must start preparing now for what is sure to be an unprecedented and logistically challenging general election. 

Older adults and those with underlying conditions are at higher risk for severe illness as a result of COVID-19 [(#)](https://www.cdc.gov/coronavirus/2019-ncov/need-extra-precautions/people-at-higher-risk.html). This is particularly concerning when considering overall voter turnout because older Americans are historically much more likely to vote. In 2016, citizens 65 years and older voted at higher rates (70.9%) than 45-64 year olds (66.6%), 30-44 year olds (48.7%), and 18-29 year olds (46.1%) [(#)](https://www.census.gov/newsroom/blogs/random-samplings/2017/05/voting_in_america.html).

In 2016, only 60% of eligible voters participated in the US presidential election [(#)](http://www.electproject.org/2016g). While total voter turnout for Maryland in the 2016 general election was 72%, voter turnout in Baltimore City was only slightly better than the national average at 62% [(#)](https://elections.maryland.gov/elections/2016/turnout/general/Official%20by%20Party%20and%20County.pdf).


In Maryland, citizens who are registered to vote can vote for the general election in one of three ways:
* Early Voting, in-person between October 22nd and 29th between 8am-8pm.
* Absentee ballot, mailed ballot by election day. 
* Election Day, in-person at assigned polling place. 
With a state-wide shelter-in-place and social distancing guidelines of keeping people 6ft apart, in-person voting will likely decrease and place more importance on mail-in absentee ballots. We've already seen this happen in several primaries [(4)](https://www.npr.org/2020/03/16/815504537/voting-amid-coronavirus-what-you-need-to-know).

It is vital that we understand the implications of the pandemic on the election to best know what measures can and should be taken to adapt voting systems to allow as many eligible voters to participate under the circumstances. 

#### Original Question: Outline the “why” for analysing this data set and what questions you hope to answer by conducting data analysis. 
* Link outside sources to support your need for answering this question, and provide personal/professional background on why this is an interest to you.

## Data Sources and Tools
* Define the data-related questions and metrics, which includes identifying at least one open dataset that helps you answer your business question

## Analysis with Excel/Python/Mapbox
* Perform calculations for defined metrics based on your own insights or other industry standards, build models to help explain these data insights, and create data visualizations to answer your data-related questions
* use any of the techniques we've talked about in class (pivot tables/charts, simple & multiple linear regression, clustering)
* outline data analytics process 
* If Python: Write code, notes, and markdown cells in a notebook-style IDE if you choose to conduct data analysis in Python
* If Excel: a step-by-step outline of your data manipulation if you conduct analysis in Excel 
  * include data cleaning and combining (VLOOKUP, IF statements, etc)

## Data Results
* Summarize findings 
* Data visualization 

## Insights and Actions

### Data Interpretation
* Relate the data findings back to your initial business question and larger civic issue to propose insights, findings, and/or recommendations that go beyond the metrics (i.e. what do these numbers mean, how can this be used in the field, and what additional data or metrics should be collected/conducted to drive better solutions?)
* What do your findings mean and why are these important to you? Who might benefit from this data analysis? What additional information might you need to draw further conclusions?

### Solution
What’s your business answer and how did you come to this conclusion from your data analysis? What is the impact of your findings? Tell your reader up front what you found, and then support your findings with summary statements about and links to your analysis that you’ve uploaded to your GitHub repository. In some cases, you won’t be able to “solve” the business question because this is related to a larger systemic challenge or something that relies on many outside forces to solve. That’s okay--explain why this might be the case, and use your data analysis to support these statements. Interpret your methods in big-picture analysis, simple linear regression, correlation, multiple linear regression, and clustering into words that a general audience can understand, and relate these findings back to your original business question. Clear data visualizations and data tables can easily help point out trends, outliers, and distributions. Initially you told us why we should care about the problem, now tell us what you, an industry, company, group, demographic, or the reader can do about it based on your analysis. Be specific about your business answer, but don’t get lost in the details. Instead of saying “the trend shows that there is a problem with employment,” specifically point out the decline/increase or use a data visualization to specifically point out problem points. However, don’t get too specific in providing context for your analysis--the audience might want to point out specific significant variables from a linear regression model, but you don’t need to post a screenshot of the result of your full analysis table or list out the prediction equation or exact p-values for each variable. This section is the “meat” of your executive summary, but this shouldn’t be longer than a couple paragraphs.

### Future Suggestions
Now that you told us what needs to happen for your problem as a result of your analysis, how does this come into play in the next 6 months? Year? Ten years? What would you recommend happens in this industry/situation from an organizational, policy, leadership, or some other type of shift or pivot? Why is the future brighter based on this change and why should people care about this? This is similar to a conclusion, but also gives a clear call-to-action to the designated group/people who can do something about your original business question. This section should be about one paragraph.
